function solution(statues) {
  // Ex: For statues = [6, 2, 3, 8], the output should be solution(statues) = 3 because the needed statues are 4, 5, and 7
  // Create a new array that has all the integers from the min to the max
  // min = (Math.min(...array)) to max = (Mathm.max(...array))
  // (Method 1) take out any duplicate integers in statues (this step could possibly be skipped because none of the tests have duplicate elements) & subtract the lengths of the arrays
  // (Method 2) filter out any elements in the new array that are not part of statues array, and take its length
  // (Method 3) maybe use sort, and do ???
